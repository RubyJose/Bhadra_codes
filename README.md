# Bhadra_codes

The Reservoir_simultaion_codes folder contains the following files:
1) The program ReserSim.c 
2) The reservoir_operation.h file that contains the reservoir operation rules 
3) The subroutines of IHA indicators given as C++ header files (17 files) that are used for the computation of IHA statistics  
4) The data file, GAVariables.dat, which contains the decision variables generated from Borg (that are to be read into the reservoir simulation code)
5) Another header file, sort_ascend.h, that is used for sorting the flow data. 

While compiling the ReserSim.c program, all the above files are to be kept in the same folder (21 files). The details on the header files of IHA subroutines are given in 
a seperate Readme file insid the folder. 


The Principal_component_analysis consists of the PCA code written in Matlab and its input file. 

The Optimization_outputs folder has the outputs from Borg-MOEA for the three optimization formulation runs discssed in the manuscript.
